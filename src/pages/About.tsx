          <p>
            I am a passionate self-taught web developer. My journey started out
            of curiosity to know how the internet and computers work. Along the
            way I acquired new technical skills and new ways of dealing with
            problems as well as enhancing my ability to solve problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            My strongest strength is that I like to face situations that
            challenges me and my skills, which will gain me more experience to
            solve future alike problems faster.
